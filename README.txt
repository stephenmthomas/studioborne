[1] ABOUT
	Studioborne is a small application that allows the user to display scales and
	chords from western music on a keyboard and fretboard.  This can be useful for
	musicians and teachers, or people not well versed in music theory who wish to
	adhere to its principles.

	LATEST VERSION: 0.95
	RELEASE DATE: 13 NOV 2020
	

[2] GENERAL FEATURES
	On the main window, you should start by selecting a key and mode/scale.  By
	default, the program will select C Major.
	
	Once a key and scale are selected, the fretboard and keyboard will display either
	the notes in the scale, or the notes of the selected chord. You can redisplay
	the selected scale by changing the key to a different note and then back.
	
	The options all have descriptions of what they do if you hover the mouse over
	text.  (A tool tip will pop up.)  Currently, colored note blips aren't supported.
	
	The popular progression options don't do anything.  I put them there as a 
	reminder for myself.
	

[3] KNOWN ISSUES
	The fretboard is terrible.  Really.  And while it technically displays chords
	correctly, it isn't exactly usable.  I'll be working on this.
	
	The fretboard tuning IS NOT idiot proof.  If you don't enter a tuning of the
	appropriate format, weird things could happen. (Likely, the program will crash.)
	Standing tuning looks like this for guitar: E,A,D,G,B,E
	And for bass: E,A,D,G
	
	The user interface is friggin' gnarly.  I'll freshen it up soon. Until then,
	good luck.
